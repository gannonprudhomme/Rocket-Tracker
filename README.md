# RocketTracker
Executable rank tracker written in Java for the video game Rocket League, using the [RLStats API](http://documentation.rocketleaguestats.com/). The purpose of RocketTracker is to make it simple and easy to regularly track your progression through ranks. Likewise, RocketTracker opens more opportunities for stat analysis through things such as per-game stat recording(Goals, Saves, Shots, etc),  win-streaks and average stats per session.

## Features

 - Load, Save, and Open previous sessions to continue where you left off
 - Get per-game stats over time
 - Multi-playlist stat recording
 - Real-time rank/match updates
 
## Usage
1. Clone and add the project to Eclipse/Netbeans/etc.
2. Navigate to StatManager.java and change steamID to the corresponding steam ID(or change the platform if not on Steam)
3. Run RocketTracker.java in the background while you play
4. (Optional) Save the session when you're done by going to File->Save Session
