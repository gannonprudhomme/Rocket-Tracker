- Sorta the idea of the entire program is to make it easy to regularly track your progression through ranks
- This includes specific things like goals(goals per game) shots, saves, etc, over time.
    - Possibly to find a correlation within the data, ie shooting less -> losing more
		- Which is kind of self-explanatory
		- Stats per game vs teammates when losing and vs teammate's mmr(versus my own)
			- ie. when teammates mmr is lower than mine, what are my stats like(and vice versa)
				- when partied, when solo queuing, etc
- 
- Could possibly

Recent TODO
	- Save & Load sessions
	- Ranks & Divisions next to MMR
	- Have hashes be in increments of 10
	
TODO
	- Graphs for goals per game, shots per game, etc
		- How / Where should I start this process
	- Graph title with playlist and possibly player
	- Could give you daily summaries
		- Net MMR change in each playlist
		- Average stats in each playlist
		- Highest win & loss streaks
	- export to pdf
	- ingame overlay
	- Either shrink the graph(scale down x) or extend the window & graph to the right, when too many games have been played to be displayed
	- Have time to next rank update on the same level/above the tabs
	
Future
	- Update the player every so often in a diff thread 
		- Depending on what MMR changed, update that tab  
	- Have weekly summaries
	- Have the net changes in a single session to the left of the GraphPanel
	- Have a session library that shows like a tooltip/preview summary of it(like a movie library)
		- What would be the point? You would never want to continue from a session & skipping a day/session
	- Have multiple ways to continue a session. Default would be continue one session throughout the day
	- Have what rank & div beside the mmr, or solely have hashes by div's (or in 10s, depending on the diff between divisions
	- Could eventually detect if the player was in actively matchmaking or not
	- check casuals as it will affect stats
	- Different colors for different sessions in one graph
	
Ideas
	- Be a tooltip like bakkes mod when it's not enabled, could be an overlay like it?
		- contact bakkes
		- In-game overlay
	- Minimize to system tray
	- Read RL memory for stats and such, so you would never need to check ranks
		- Or, read when a match has been completed, so you know when to check ranks
		- Ask Bakkes how he knows when a match is completed?
			- Bakkes mod most likely only updates ranks when the matches are completed/
	- Analyze replay files as well(somehow save them automatically?) 
		- could poll rocket league position memory
		- otherwise, would require the user to save replays manually after every game
			- could somehow automatically save the replay for the user	
	
Bugs
	- Middle y-axis value changing when min/maxes do
	- Can add matches to solo standard when only standard/private matches had been played
	- GraphPanel.shaveOnesDigit(int) probably doesn't work for 3 digit values
	
Completed To-Do
	- Grid lines
		- x & y axis markers
	- Hover over point to show match info
	- Load the intial starting point when creating a new Session/SessionTab
	- Split y hashes by thirds, with 1/3 being the top/max value, 2/3 -> start/middle value, 3/3 -> bottom/min value
		- Have to rewrite hash space calculations completely, split into spaces between top half and bottom half
		- Points need to shift alongside the hash marks
			- Divide (maxY - minY) / (numYDivisions), ensuring middle is starting y-value?
		- Doesn't really matter what the y-intercept is, as long as the mmr values correlate to the hash-marks
